// (the asm half of exceptions.rs). The constants are substituted rather than duplicated: a 64-bit
// assembler cannot read a Rust `const`, and the alternative is two files that can drift. The three
// `*_OFF` ones are `gs`-relative byte offsets into `cpu::PerCpu::x86_trap` (milestone 161's SMP
// item), computed by `core::mem::offset_of!` rather than hand-counted, so a field added or reordered
// in `cpu.rs` cannot silently desynchronize the assembly that reaches through them.
