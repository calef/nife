# helpers/stash-block.sh: make `git stash` fail in every worktree that shares this `.git`.
#
#     helpers/stash-block.sh              # install the block if it is missing; say why if it cannot
#     helpers/stash-block.sh --selftest   # prove it in a throwaway repository
#
# Why. The stash stack is one ref, `refs/stash`, shared by every worktree on the machine, so one
# lane's `git stash pop` can pop another lane's entry (notes/skills/worktree-commits/SKILL.md; the
# incident is in design/tenets/git-in-a-worktree.md). Saying so did not stop it, so this takes the
# state away instead of warning about it.
#
# How. Git refuses a ref whose name is a directory of other refs. With `refs/stash/<BLOCK>` present,
# `refs/stash` cannot be created, and `git stash` (push, save, `-u`, and every `--autostash`) fails
# with "Cannot save the current status" before it touches the working tree. Loose and packed refs
# both enforce it. The block points at main's root commit, which is reachable anyway.
#
# Exit 0 when the block is in place (already, or installed now). Exit 1 when it cannot be installed
# because a stash already exists: those entries are some lane's work, so this lists them and never
# drops them. Whoever owns them turns each into a patch file and drops it, and the next run installs
# the block.
#
# Run by script/claim on every lane it cuts, and by helpers/pre-push-fleet.sh on every fleet push,
# so a clone that opted in to the fleet is blocked within one claim or push.
#
# BUGS
#
# - The error git prints names neither this file nor the rule. `git for-each-ref refs/stash` shows
#   the block, and its name says where to read.
# - `git update-ref -d` on the block removes it. Nothing reinstalls it until the next claim or push.

# Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-19 (UTC) by lane/118-budget-rules-2-3 (milestone 118 (CLAUDE.md has a budget)'s budget
# rule 3). calef has not ruled on it.
