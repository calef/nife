# Selftest: the DUE half of helpers/trunk-health.sh (milestone 495 (a cadence that says "due" reaches nobody))
# turns each way `script/stranger-test --due` and `script/audits --due` can answer into the right
# row, and never into silence it cannot justify. Run by script/lint.
#
# The exit code is the authority and the sentence is the detail. A scratch copy of the tree holds
# stub scripts, so one real `--once` pass runs against canned answers, no network and no record:
#
#   - exit 1 with the DUE sentence: a DUE row in the three-column shape.
#   - exit 1 with no DUE sentence (a record that would not read): a `cannot ask` row.
#   - the script missing or not executable: the same `cannot ask` row, because the call fails.
#   - exit 1 with reworded text (`overdue:` for `DUE:`): `cannot ask`, never silence. This is the
#     guard against the scripts' wording drifting away from the sed this watcher reads them with.
#   - exit 0, even with DUE text on stdout: no row.
