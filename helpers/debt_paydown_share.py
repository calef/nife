"""Which merged pull requests carry the `debt-paydown` label, for the metrics page.

    helpers/debt_paydown_share.py update        # fetch every merged pull request, rewrite the CSV
    helpers/debt_paydown_share.py --selftest

Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-11 (UTC) by lane maintainer/debt-paydown-share-chart, for this
file, `notes/project-metrics/merged-pull-requests.csv` and its columns. A python helper under
`helpers/`, outside `script/names`' scope, so this paragraph is its provenance.

# WHY

calef asked on 2026-10-11 (UTC) for a chart of the share of pull requests that pay down debt. The
label and its definition are in notes/debt-paydown.md. A label lives on GitHub and not in git, so
`script/metrics`, which reads git and committed records only, cannot see it. This helper is the
fetch, run by the metrics workflow before `script/metrics --update`, and its CSV is the committed
record `script/metrics` sums by week. The same split `helpers/merge_queue_share.py` uses, for the
same reason.

# WHAT IT WRITES

One row per pull request merged into `main`: `number`, `merged_day` (the UTC date GitHub gives as
`mergedAt`) and `debt_paydown` (1 when the label is on it at the time of the fetch, else 0). One row
per pull request rather than a daily sum, so a reader can check any week's count against the pull
requests behind it, and so a relabel is visible in the diff as the one row it changes.

**The whole history is fetched every run and the file rewritten**, unlike the merge queue's
eight-day window. A label can be added to or taken off a pull request merged months ago (the
backfill of 2026-10-10 labeled 641 of them at once, and notes/debt-paydown.md tells a lane to fix a
wrong one by hand), so a window would leave the record disagreeing with GitHub for good. The fetch
is one paginated listing, about ten seconds for 1,900 pull requests on 2026-10-11.

Only pull requests whose base is `main`. Seventeen merged into another branch by 2026-10-11, a lane
stacked on a lane, and their work reached `main` inside the parent's pull request; counting them
would count that work twice, and `merged_pull_requests` (merge commits on `main`) does not count
them either.

# BUGS

- The label is read as it stands on the day of the fetch, not as it stood when the pull request
  merged. That is the intent (a corrected label should correct history), but it means a past week's
  share can move on any run.
- The fetch refuses to write a file shorter than the one it would replace, since a merged pull
  request cannot unmerge; a truncated listing is the likelier explanation. A pull request whose base
  was retargeted away from `main` after it merged would trip the same refusal. None has.
