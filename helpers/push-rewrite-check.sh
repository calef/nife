# helpers/push-rewrite-check.sh: refuse a push that would rewrite a commit already on the remote.
#
#     helpers/pre-push-fleet.sh queued   # runs this first, with git's ref lines on stdin
#     helpers/push-rewrite-check.sh --selftest
#
# Why. A pushed commit is never rewritten (calef, 2026-10-18 UTC; notes/skills/worktree-commits/SKILL.md):
# no reset, rebase, amend or force-push on a commit the remote has. The reasons are in
# design/tenets/git-in-a-worktree.md. Locally a rewrite is invisible until it is pushed, so the push
# is the one place it can be refused, and only a forced push can carry one.
#
# The rule. For each ref, the remote's sha must be an ancestor of the sha being pushed. A new ref
# (remote sha all zeros) and a deletion (local sha all zeros) pass. A remote sha this clone has never
# fetched fails too, because a fast-forward cannot be proven and a forced push over it would discard
# commits nobody here has seen: fetch, merge, and push again.
#
# Exit 0 lets the push go, exit 1 refuses it. No override: `git push --no-verify` is the only way
# past, and the lane rules forbid it. It needs no network.
#
# BUGS
#
# - It sees only pushes from a clone with `nife.fleet` set. The bot workflows force-push their own
#   branches from CI, which is why nothing server-side refuses a force-push on every branch.
#
# Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-19 (UTC) by lane/118-budget-rules-2-3 (milestone 118 (CLAUDE.md has a budget)'s budget
# rule 3), after helpers/push-queued-check.sh. calef has not ruled on it.
