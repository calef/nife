# Selftest: the repeat half of helpers/trunk-health.sh reports a workflow whose scheduled failures
# say the same thing again, and reports churn without folding it in. Run by script/lint.
#
# Milestone 422 (a cadence job whose healthy state is red, and nothing that notices it repeating),
# provisional. The grouping thresholds and the log-frame strip decide whether a standing failure is
# seen at all, so this proves them offline rather than trusting the next week of real failures to
# do it: a stub `gh` serving synthetic run lists and synthetic `--log-failed` logs, a stub `git`
# answering the two calls `state()` makes, and one real `--once` pass whose repeat rows are then
# read back. No network, and the real repository's run history is never touched; the workflow names
# are this tree's so the scheduled-file grep finds them, and every date in the fixtures is a
# synthetic UTC stand-in for the real 2026-09..10 audit-cadence specimen.
#
# What each fixture pins, and what breaks if the code regresses:
#
#   - audit-cadence, four of six failing runs ending in one line: the REPEAT row, with the line
#     and the span of dates. Inside it, one run's log carries teardown noise ahead of the error
#     annotation (dropped by name, or the group reads 3), one carries only the echoed script
#     (dropped as a frame line, or the group reads CHURN), and one run failed on a different line
#     altogether and must stay out of the group. The newest log carries text after the annotation,
#     which the marker cutoff must exclude.
#   - falsifications, two failing runs on different lines: the CHURN row as its own finding.
#   - mutation, four failing runs where two share a line: CHURN, "no line three times", so a pair
#     never reads as a repeat.
#   - undefined-behavior-check, two cancelled and four failed runs: cancelled is not a failure, so
#     the row must say four, not six.
#   - vendor-watch, two failing runs on the same line: silence, because an unconfirmed repeat
#     waits for its third occurrence.
#   - toolchain-bump, all green: silence.
#   - trunk-health and merge-drain, fixture data present: silence, because the watcher files are
#     excluded the same way script/cadence-check excludes them.
