# helpers/host-excluded-crates.sh: which workspace crates cannot compile for the host, derived
# from cargo's own dependency graph rather than listed by hand.
#
# A crate that reaches `crates/user_mode_runtime` cannot compile for the host: `svc` and `ecall`
# there are EL0 syscalls, and with no nife kernel under them they fault. `cargo tree -i` answers
# exactly that question of the graph itself, so the answer moves when a dependency moves and
# cannot lag behind one. This file is the tree's single derivation of that set (roadmap 393). Its
# consumers run it instead of carrying the list: script/lint's two clippy passes, `cargo xtask
# test`'s host and Miri passes (xtask/src/suite.rs), script/coverage's run and its floor, and
# script/mutation's cargo-mutants call. script/lint's "the host pass excludes exactly the
# bare-metal crates" gate derives the set a second way, from `cargo metadata`, and fails when the
# two disagree or when a consumer stops calling this file; that gate keeps this derivation honest,
# and this derivation keeps the consumers in step.
#
# Hand lists were the record until 2026-10-15, and that is how the exclusion set went wrong on
# 2026-08-03 and stayed wrong for eleven days, invisible because CI had moved to an aarch64 runner
# the same day, where the EL0 assembly compiles by accident. script/lint's gate tells that story
# whole.
#
#   helpers/host-excluded-crates.sh          crate names, one per line
#   helpers/host-excluded-crates.sh paths    the same crates as paths relative to the root
#
# Names provisional (lane milestone/393), like every other name a lane mints.
