#
# # Why this exists
#
# Every CI job fetches the pinned nightly from static.rust-lang.org, because no job caches it, and
# rustup makes one attempt at a connection. On 2026-10-18 a TCP connect to the CDN timed out once
# (30 s) in `script/bootstrap`, and a docs-only pull request went red for it. On 2026-10-08 the
# floating `nightly` manifest failed its checksum while the CDN was mid-publish, and that one ejected
# a pull request from the merge queue. Both cleared on the next try. notes/ci-toolchain-download.md
# has the two weeks of counts this was measured against.
#
# # What it retries, and what it does not
#
# Only a failure whose output looks like a download: a connect or DNS error, a timeout, a checksum
# mismatch. Anything else (an unknown target, a typo in a component) fails on the first attempt with
# rustup's own message, because retrying a real error four times only hides it for two minutes.
#
# NIFE_RUSTUP_ATTEMPTS (default 4) bounds the attempts. NIFE_RUSTUP_BACKOFF (default 10) is the
# first wait in seconds, tripled after each failure: 10, 30, 90, which with rustup's 30-second
# connect timeout puts the worst case near five minutes, inside every job's budget.
# helpers/rustup-retry-selftest.sh, run by script/lint, holds all of this against a stub rustup.
