# PROVISIONAL NAME. Minted 2026-08-04; not put to calef. See the `Name:` block below.
#
# # Why this exists
#
# Nothing owned trunk health, and the gap was in the role definitions rather than in anyone's
# execution. A developer works one milestone in one lane and cannot see `main` by design. The
# steward watches pull request checks, conflicts, at-risk work and idle lanes, and its charter never
# mentioned the trunk. The maintainer is told to keep hygiene, and that list is prune the worktree,
# delete the branch, relink `nife-dev`, leave no QEMU. So the role that merges is the role that
# breaks `main`, and the role that exists to compensate for the merger being busy was not pointed at
# the thing merging breaks.
#
# **The signal was never missing** was this file's claim from 2026-08-04, and on 2026-09-23 it was
# **falsified and is corrected here rather than deleted**, because the correction is the lesson. CI
# does run on every push to `main` and has all along; what was wrong is the step after it, which is
# this script's own: that a green CI conclusion means a healthy tree. It does not. `ci.yml` skips
# the steps of the build jobs (`test`, `swish-check`, `boot-check`, and `swish-check-graphical` until its 2026-10-03 fold into `swish-check`)
# when every changed path matches `notes/`, `design/` or a root `*.md`, so a
# documentation-only commit posts a green required check having built and run nothing. That is a
# sound rule for a kernel and a false one for `crates/documentation`, whose tests RENDER those very
# files: `every_character_survives` never ran, `main` was broken for hours, and every signal a reader
# or this watcher could reach said green. Pull request #1168 fixes the skip. The durable lesson is
# about this file: **a conclusion is a claim about what ran, not about the tree.**
#
# The original point stands underneath it. On 2026-08-04 `main` went red and was found by someone
# running `script/lint` by hand after a merge, which is luck rather than process. This reads the
# signal that already exists, and now says what that signal does not cover.
#
# # What it says, and what it deliberately does not
#
# It reports the transition to red, naming the failing workflows, and the transition back to green.
# A green reached by citing a merge-group run rather than repeating it says so, with the run IDs.
# It does **not** report every red poll, because a trunk that stays broken for an hour is one fact
# and not twenty-four.
#
# It says "nobody is assigned to this" on purpose. A red trunk with an owner is a task; a red trunk
# without one is the failure this script exists to surface, and the wording is the difference.
#
# **Recovery is reported too, deliberately.** A watcher that only speaks on failure trains its reader
# to treat silence as health, and silence is also what a dead watcher produces.
#
# # Where this runs, and the watch that was folded in here and then unfolded (2026-09-24)
#
# **The trunk half runs in GitHub Actions as `nife-smelter[bot]`**, on a five-minute schedule:
# `.github/workflows/trunk-health.yml`, which carries the reasoning, the tested premise, and the
# cadence BUGS. It used to run under `launchd` on patagonia as calef's own token.
#
# **`helpers/at-risk-check.sh` did not come along, and could not have.** It was folded into this
# script's loop on 2026-09-23 on the reasoning that a third watcher is a third thing to start and a
# third thing that can die silently, and that `com.nife.trunk-health` was already firing on the
# right interval. That reasoning was correct for as long as both halves ran on the same machine.
# They no longer do: everything else here reads GitHub, while the at-risk check reads **this
# machine's** worktrees and their `git status`. A runner has no lane worktrees, so carrying the fold
# into Actions would have produced a check that reports nothing forever while the hazard it exists
# for sat on somebody's laptop unwatched, which is worse than not having it.
#
# So the at-risk watch is per developer, one per machine, under its own `launchd` job, and it needs
# no GitHub credential at all. notes/merge-queue.md has the plist and the retirement commands for
# the two jobs this replaces. `--once` here still reports it, because a person running this by hand
# on their own machine is exactly the case where both halves are true at once.
#
# # The thing that would prevent this rather than detect it
#
# GitHub's require-branches-to-be-up-to-date rule, applied 2026-08-04 (§73). Two pull requests, each
# green against the base it was cut from, merged in an order neither had ever been tested in and put
# `main` red. That rule forces a re-run against the new `main`, turning that failure into one re-run
# instead of a broken trunk. This script is the detection half; the rule is the prevention half.
#
# # BUGS
#
#   - **A green from a push that skipped its suites is sound, and says so** (A′, 2026-09-24). CI and
#     verify skip on a push to `main` when a `merge_group` run of the same workflow concluded
#     `success` at that exact commit, because the queue builds the very commit that lands. Those
#     runs conclude `success` with every gated job skipped, so this script reads them green, and
#     prints the merge-group runs it is relying on so a reader can tell that green from the one
#     below. It trusts the gate's lookup rather than re-deriving it: it does not check that the run
#     it names belongs to the same workflow as each skipped push run, only that some merge-group run
#     at this commit succeeded (CI or verify, whichever it found).
#   - **A green conclusion is not a healthy tree, and this script cannot tell the difference.** See
#     the correction above: a check whose steps were skipped reports `success`, so this watcher says
#     GREEN while the test that would have caught the breakage never ran. Nothing here reads whether
#     a job did any work, and a fix would mean reading each run's steps rather than its conclusion,
#     which is a different and much chattier API. Until then, a docs-only merge is a moment to
#     distrust this watcher rather than to be reassured by it.
#   - **It reports and never resolves**, deliberately, which was the whole gap calef named on
#     2026-09-23. The response now exists as `helpers/queue-hold.sh` and briefs/main-is-red.md, and
#     a person still has to run it: this script does not, because holding the queue needs the
#     judgement notes/merge-queue.md argues a watcher must not exercise.
#   - **It does not report its own death.** Shared with `helpers/merge-drain.sh`, accepted rather
#     than solved; notes/merge-queue.md has the reasoning and the `launchd` plists.
#   - **"Transition" means newly observed, not newly due.** The red/green, cadence and DUE memories
#     (`prev`, `prev_cadence`, `prev_due`) live in the watching shell and die with it, so a restart
#     announces the current state on its first pass as if it were new: a cadence that has stood due
#     for a month is re-reported once by every restart, and a due that clears while nothing is
#     watching is never reported at all. No persistent state sits behind any transition in this
#     script; that has been true of the RED/GREEN and cadence halves all along and is stated once,
#     here.
#   - **The repeat half reads logs through `gh run view --log-failed`, which is a screen, not an
#     API.** Its two leading columns, its timestamp, its ANSI-marked script echoes and its runner
#     teardown lines are stripped by pattern, and the "final line" is the last content line before
#     GitHub's own `##[error]Process completed with exit code` annotation. A log that will not
#     parse lands in an unreadable-line group rather than a wrong one; the pattern strip is where
#     this breaks first if `gh` changes its log shape. Run 34109632590 (2026-09-07 UTC) is the
#     known case of teardown lines arriving ahead of the annotation, and the strip handles it.
#   - **The repeat half spends real API quota, on purpose and bounded.** One listing call per
#     scheduled workflow plus two calls per failing run examined, on every pass that reads it.
#     That cost is why the watching loop below does not call it; the Actions relay is the reader.
#   - **A repeat row reports, and the issue the relay opens is its home and its close condition.**
#     What the row asks for ("run the audit") is a lane and a day. `helpers/repeat_issue.py` opens
#     one issue per workflow on the `trunk-health.yml` pass, and the issue body names the close:
#     the audit lane's report pull request says `Closes #N`. This script's own output still closes
#     nothing, and the watching loop below opens nothing either.

# **A scheduled workflow's red is invisible to `state()` above, structurally rather than by
# oversight**, and that is why this second question is asked here (milestone 238). `state()` filters
# runs to `headSha == main`'s current tip, which is the right filter for "is the trunk broken" and
# the wrong one for a cadence: a weekly job's run matches the tip only until the next merge, and at
# this tree's merge rate that window is minutes. So `mutation testing` failed four Mondays running
# and this watcher, pointed straight at the same API, could not have seen any of them.
#
# `script/cadence-check` is where the judgment lives; this only decides when to speak. Same
# transition discipline as RED/GREEN, for the same reason: a cadence that has been dead for a month
# is one fact, not four hundred polls of it. The call is captured rather than passed through,
# because a dead cadence is its exit 1 and this script runs under `set -e`.
#
# **Two of the cadences are asked here rather than by `script/cadence-check`** (milestone 889 (the
# tree's gates stop depending on the fleet tooling), provisional, 2026-10-12 UTC). The weekly capture
# of machine effort and the two merge watchers measure the fleet that runs agent lanes, and
# cadence-check is a tree tool that a stranger's clone keeps, so it no longer calls either. Both
# are asked on the same five-minute pass as before, in the same row format, so the transitions and
# trunk-health.yml's DEAD warning read them exactly as they did.
#
# **A pass that could not ask gets a row, so the stream never empties on one.** `script/cadence-check`
# exits 2 with nothing on stdout when it cannot ask (no `gh`, no network, no credentials), and a
# nonzero exit with no rows prints a `cannot ask` row here, in the `due()` section's shape. That
# makes cannot-ask a state of the stream the `prev_cadence` compare reads, not a hole in it: the
# compare speaks on the transition into it, stays silent while it stands, and its recovery line
# fires only when a real answer empties the stream. The row is deliberately not DEAD-prefixed: the
# workflow that relays this script warns on a DEAD grep, and one blind pass is weather there, not a
# dead workflow. helpers/trunk-health-cadence-selftest.sh holds the failure cases (name
# provisional).
#
# The effort capture (milestone 519 (what this project costs, tracked where it cannot rot)) is a
# person running `script/effort --update` on the machine the lanes ran on, because only that
# machine has the session records; `--check` asks whether the committed `effort.csv` holds the
# current week, which needs no network and no records. It prints its row only when dead, the
# `--quiet` rule. The merge watchers (milestone 723 (a stopped merge watcher is reported within
# three of its own intervals)) have their own rule, from their own cron, in helpers/watcher_watch.py.

# --- DUE: a cadence that says "a person must now do something" ----------------------------------
#
# **A due cadence is not a dead one, and the two cadences that mean "due" reached this watcher only
# as the second thing** (milestone 495 (a cadence that says "due" reaches nobody, and the watcher
# cannot tell due from dead)). The stranger cadence (`script/stranger-test --due`) and the audit cadence
# (`script/audits --due`) both exist to say "a person must now do something", and red in the Actions
# tab is their correct output, not their failure. `script/cadence-check` answers only whether a
# scheduled workflow has stopped *succeeding*, so a job correctly reporting due and a job that is
# broken arrive as the same verdict, DEAD, a fortnight after the fact. The audits sat that way for
# five Mondays before anyone acted; that sentence with dates is milestone 495's evidence section.
#
# So this section asks the scripts themselves, not the workflows that relay them. Both `--due` modes
# read records already on disk (the stranger note's run headings, the audit index), need no network,
# no toolchain and no credential, and answer in seconds on the checkout this watcher already holds.
# That is milestone 495's option 1, taken for the reason it gives: it reuses the watcher a
# maintainer session is already told to confirm is alive, adds no scheduled workflow to the ones
# cadence-check polices, takes no `issues: write`, and opens no second channel. It is deliberately
# not a gate and not in `script/lint`, for the reason `script/cadence-check`'s header already wrote
# down: a due cadence is not a defect in the commit that happens to trip it.
#
# **The verdict speaks on transition, like everything else in this loop.** A cadence that stands due
# for a month is one fact, and the transition discipline is also what keeps DUE from becoming the
# standing alarm the block warns a due-echo would be: speak when something becomes due, speak when
# it clears, and not on the polls between. Clearing means the work was done (a run written up, or
# audits run and their rows added), or that the record moved underneath; both scripts' own BUGS
# sections name the edit-to-silence hole, and this inherits it rather than policing it. The recovery
# line, like RED/GREEN's, exists because a watcher that only speaks on failure trains its reader to
# treat silence as health.
#
# **A record that would not read gets a row rather than silence.** Exit 1 from a `--due` mode means
# "due" and also "the record could not be read" (a malformed or missing one), and the second case
# prints nothing on stdout, so the DUE sentence itself is what tells the two apart. Saying nothing
# about the second would recreate, in miniature, the silence this section exists to close.

# --- REPEAT: a scheduled workflow that keeps failing with the same final line --------------------
#
# **Red is ambiguous for a job whose healthy state is red on purpose, and a repeat is the part a
# conclusion alone cannot say** (milestone 422 (a cadence job whose healthy state is red)). `audit-cadence` has failed every scheduled Monday
# since it was created, and almost all of those runs are the mechanism working: an audit was due,
# the workflow said so, and red is its correct output. Buried among them, on 2026-09-14, sat one
# run that failed on `FileNotFoundError` instead, broken for real and indistinguishable in the
# Actions tab from the correct reds on both sides of it. The `due()` section above cannot see that
# difference, because it asks the tree's scripts what is due now, and on 2026-09-14 the tree was
# fine: the workflow was broken. So this section asks the other witness, GitHub's own run history,
# the read-only source `script/cadence-check` already reads: what did each failing run's step
# actually print last.
#
# The sketch is the block's, unchanged: take the last six scheduled runs of each scheduled
# workflow, group the failed ones by the final line of their failing step, and report a workflow
# whose largest group holds three or more, naming the line and the span of dates (UTC). Three is
# the block's threshold, not this script's invention: one failure is weather, two same-line
# failures on a weekly cadence are a coincidence and a confirmation, and the row waits for the
# third, accepting the lag. A workflow whose failures disagree with each other is CHURN, a
# separate and less urgent finding on its own row, never folded into the repeat one; the block's
# word for it. A single line failing exactly twice is an unconfirmed repeat and stays silent until
# the third occurrence settles which it is.
#
# **The line is compared whole, digits included.** A mutation failure's final line names the mutant
# that killed it, and those lines differ for good reason; a key that normalized numbers away would
# merge genuinely different failures into one false repeat. The specimen needs no normalization:
# the audit-cadence runs end in an epilogue printed by `script/audits` itself ("design/
# audit-reports/README.md says how, ..."), identical across every due-red, which is why the
# FileNotFoundError run falls out of its group on its own.
#
# **The per-workflow runs endpoint is the point, not a style choice.** The all-workflows listing
# `script/cadence-check` uses caps at 100 runs, and at this tree's daily cadence that window no
# longer reaches back to a weekly's own last six: on 2026-10-16 it held a single audit-cadence
# run. cadence-check's BUGS records the same cap biting its own 15-day threshold.
#
# **Reading the final line is best effort, because `gh run view --log-failed` is a screen rather
# than an API** (the header's BUGS carries the caveat). The frame is stripped, then the content:
# `repeat_line` below says what each pattern is for. A log that yields nothing readable groups as
# "(final line could not be read)" instead of pretending to a line it never saw.
#
# **Cost, and why the loop below does not call this.** One listing call per scheduled workflow,
# plus two per failing run of any workflow with two or more failures in its last six: at this
# tree's failures that is a few dozen calls per pass. The watching loop polls every 90 seconds,
# and on that cadence the spend runs past what the credential the merge drain shares should pay
# for a report. `trunk-health.yml` runs `--once` every five minutes and is the reader that exists;
# a person running `--once` by hand gets the same rows. Like DEAD and DUE in that relay, a standing
# repeat re-announces on every pass, which that workflow's own BUGS owns.
#
# **A repeat row reports, and its home is the issue the relay opens**, not this script. What a
# repeat row asks for ("run the audit") is a lane and a day, and the home ruled for it is one open
# issue per workflow: `trunk-health.yml` hands this section's REPEAT rows to
# `helpers/repeat_issue.py`, which dedupes by workflow name, updates the body when the line drifts,
# and leaves the close to the audit lane's report pull request (`Closes #N`, routed by the
# audit-cadence step summary). This script opens nothing itself, and the watching loop below opens
# nothing either.
