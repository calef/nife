# helpers/pre-push-fleet.sh: the half of .githooks/pre-push that asks GitHub, run only on a checkout
# that opted in to the fleet tooling.
#
# Milestone 889 (the tree's gates stop depending on the fleet tooling), provisional. Before it, every
# push from every clone asked GitHub twice: once whether the branch's pull request was in the merge
# queue (helpers/push-queued-check.sh), and once whether that pull request was ready while its block
# still said IN-PROGRESS. Both questions are about a lane in calef's queue, and a stranger's push
# should not depend on `gh`, a token or the network. The hook now calls this file only when
# `git config --bool nife.fleet` is true, which script/claim sets on the machine that cuts lanes.
# `git config nife.fleet true` turns it on by hand; `git config --unset nife.fleet` turns it off.
#
# Usage (from the hook, git's ref lines on stdin: `<local ref> <local sha> <remote ref> <remote sha>`):
#
#     helpers/pre-push-fleet.sh queued   # before the empty-push skip: is the branch in the queue?
#     helpers/pre-push-fleet.sh after    # after script/lint --no-cargo: lint-fleet, then ready status
#
# Exit 0 lets the push go, exit 1 refuses it. The reasoning for each check is where it was before
# this split: push-queued-check.sh's header, and the paragraphs below, moved whole from the hook.
#
# BUGS
#
# - The opt-in is per clone, not per lane: a fleet machine that never ran script/claim, or a clone
#   made by hand, pushes without these checks until `git config nife.fleet true` is set.
#
# Name: provisional, minted 2026-10-12 (UTC) by milestone 889: the hook's name with `-fleet`,
# the suffix script/lint-fleet takes for the same split. calef has not ratified it.
