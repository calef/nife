# helpers/trunk-health-cadence-selftest.sh: prove the watcher's cadence stream treats a pass that
# could not ask as its own state, and never as an empty stream.
#
#     helpers/trunk-health-cadence-selftest.sh
#
# What it proves, against a scratch tree that copies the real helpers/trunk-health.sh and stands in
# fakes for everything that call reaches:
#
#   1. API down once, after rows: the stream carries an explicit `cannot ask` row and no recovery
#      line. This is the defect that opened the lane: the empty stream used to read as recovery.
#   2. API down across passes: the row prints once and the standing cannot-ask stays silent.
#   3. Recovery: when a real answer empties the stream, exactly one recovery line prints.
#   4. Rows after cannot-ask: real dead rows return with no recovery line beside them.
#   5. --once on an API-down pass prints the row too, being a snapshot rather than a watcher.
#
# The five passes come from a fake `sleep` that counts loop iterations and ends the watch when the
# scenario table is exhausted. A fake `git` answers as the main checkout to the watcher's worktree
# refusal and fails everywhere else, so `state()` reads an unknown tip and the test stays on the
# cadence half. `script/stranger-test` and `script/audits` are stubbed to a quiet exit 0, and
# `script/effort` and `helpers/watcher_watch.py` are absent, so every other contribution to the
# cadence and DUE streams is empty by construction. Nothing here reaches the network or `gh`.
#
# Name: provisional. Minted 2026-10-16 (UTC) by the cadence-cannot-ask lane. `trunk-health` names
# the script under test, `cadence` the half of it, and `-selftest` is the suffix this directory
# already uses. calef has not ruled on it.
#
# BUGS: the fake sleep ends the watch by signaling the watched shell, so a change to how the loop
# sleeps or stops can break the harness before it breaks an assertion.
