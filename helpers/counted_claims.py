"""Reading a counted claim: the number a `<!--count...:NAME-->` marker vouches for.

`script/lint` checks every marker against the tree; `script/metrics` reads one back as the line a
chart draws (the unsafe chart's ceiling is `unsafe-density-outside-arch`'s). Both read it here, so
a chart cannot draw a ceiling the gate is not holding. notes/counted-claims.md is the convention.

Name: provisional, minted by metrics/unsafe-chart-matches-lint on 2026-10-19 (UTC), after the
document it reads for. A shared python module under `helpers/`, which `script/names` puts out of
its own scope, so its provenance is this paragraph.

import re

# THREE relations, and neither of the other two is equality, because equality is the wrong one for
# any quantity that moves on its own.
#
#   <!--count:NAME-->           the number must EQUAL the tree. A census.
#   <!--count-at-least:NAME-->  the number must be a FLOOR. Fires only when the count goes DOWN.
#   <!--count-at-most:NAME-->   the number must be a CEILING. Fires only when the count goes UP.
#
# Why the floor (2026-08-17): `kani-harnesses` was marked in four claim sites and the count moved
# three times in one day, so every lane that added a harness had to edit four files, one of them
# README.md, which nearly every other lane touches too. That is a merge hotspot manufactured by the
# convention rather than by the tree. Reading what each site actually claimed split them cleanly:
# two are a census and want equality; two were conveying **scale** ("121 Kani harnesses across 21
# crates: the capability model, IPC, MMU isolation, ..."), and for a monotonically growing quantity
# a floor is the *true* claim while an exact equality is a maintenance tax that buys nothing.
#
# The ratchet is intact, which is the only test that matters here: a floor that goes false still
# fails the build. Deleting harnesses below a stated floor is exactly the event worth catching, and
# it is the one an equality check would have drowned in noise.
#
# **Why the ceiling (milestone 134, 2026-08-18), and it is the floor's mirror rather than a third
# idea.** A floor suits a quantity where MORE IS BETTER and the bad event is a deletion. Some
# quantities are the other way up, and unsafe is the tree's clearest one: nobody wants more of it,
# every addition should be a deliberate act with a written reason, and the bad event is a drift
# upward that no single commit looks responsible for. calef raised it as one question -- "is that
# something we should be monitoring and driving in a particular direction over time?" -- and a
# direction is exactly what the other two relations cannot express. Equality says "this is the
# number"; a floor says "at least"; only a ceiling says "and it should not grow".
#
# **What a ceiling is NOT.** It is not zero-slack, and this was measured before it was chosen. Over
# the 14 days to 2026-08-18, 38 non-merge commits changed the number of `unsafe {` outside
# kernel/src/arch/. A ceiling written at exactly the tree's value would have fired on all 38 and
# sent every one of them to edit the same line of the same note, which is precisely the merge
# hotspot the paragraph above records the convention manufacturing once already. A ceiling is
# written ABOVE the tree, with the headroom stated, so it fires on drift rather than on a lane.
#
# The exception is a population small and consequential enough that every addition deserves the
# stop: `unsafe-thread-safety-claims` is written at the tree's exact value for that reason, and it
# moved twice in three weeks rather than 38 times in two.
MARKER = re.compile(r'<!--count(-at-least|-at-most)?:([a-z0-9-]+)-->')

# Prose explaining this convention has to be able to spell it, which is the same exemption
# `script/lint`'s "daemon" check carries for the documents that argue about the word. A marker inside a
# backtick span is being QUOTED, not asserted, so blank the spans before looking. Blanked rather
# than deleted so that column positions still line up with the number-before-marker search.
CODE_SPAN = re.compile(r'`[^`]*`')

# The number a marker vouches for is the LAST number on the line before the marker, commas allowed
# so that `1,303 commits` works. Last rather than first, because a sentence usually reaches its
# number at the end ("across 21 crates") and because a line with two counts wants each marker to
# bind to the number just before it -- notes/unsafe-obligations.md is the live case, and it says
# crates before harnesses, the opposite order to everywhere else.
#
# **A count spelled in words counts too**, added by the 2026-08-17 documentation sweep, which
# needed it: the claim it went to gate was "the surface is three calls", and small counts in prose
# about a design are written as words far more often than as digits. notes/counted-claims.md
# recorded "digits or nothing" as a limitation, and this is that limitation closed rather than a
# second mechanism -- one regex and the same opt-in marker.
#
# Only small cardinals, and deliberately no composition ("twenty-one" is not read). A count large
# enough to want composing is one a person writes in digits anyway, and a parser that accepts
# "one hundred and twenty" would be guessing at prose. If a marked word is not in this table the
# gate says so rather than skipping the claim, which is the loud direction.
#
# This changes nothing about the ratchet: only a MARKED number is ever read, so admitting words
# cannot produce a false positive on the ordinary prose that says "the three of them".
