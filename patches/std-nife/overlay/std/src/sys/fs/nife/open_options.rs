//! **`OpenOptions`**: what `File::open` is asked for, and the rights it becomes.

//! Cut out of `sys/fs/nife.rs` unchanged on 2026-10-12 (UTC) by lane
//! maintainer/near-ceiling-splits, for §266 (a Rust source file stays under 2,000 lines) and §282
//! (when a file is split, the parent becomes an index). What was private to `nife` is `pub(super)`
//! here, which reaches the same modules: `nife` and its children.
//!
//! Name: provisional (lane maintainer/near-ceiling-splits, 2026-10-12 UTC), for the module and the
